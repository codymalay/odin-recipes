# odin-recipes

This website was created as an assignment for The Odin Project to 
host links to various recipes online. I have added a few of my 
favorite recipes that I have prepared recently.

It's important to note that this project is meant to refine my HTML
skills through TOP, and is in no way indicitive of my complete
programming ability. CSS styling and additional functionality
will be added at a later date.
