    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe for vegan "scallops" is easy, affordable, and surprisingly similar to actual scallops!</p>
    <p>You can find King Oyster mushrooms at your local Asian market. Mine sells packages of 6 or 7</p>
    <p>for under $3. We served these as an appetizer to the main course, but they really stole the show!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 king oyster mushrooms (sometimes called trumpet mushrooms)</li>
        <li>2-3 tbsp unsalted vegan butter</li>
        <li>3-4 sprigs of thyme</li>
        <li>2-3 cloves of garlic</li>
        <li>salt & pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a cast iron skillet over medium to medium-high heat.</li>
        <li><p>Slice the mushrooms into scallop-sized rounds. I shoot for 1-1.5". Trim the end and caps,</p>
            <p>and throw away any woody ends. Keep the edible parts and slice them, we'll still cook these!</p>
            <p>Score each side of the mushrooms, this will add surface area to allow the butter to soak in.</p></li>
        <li>Add a neutral oil to the skillet. Once hot, add your scallops and sear, about 3-4 minutes.</li>
        <li><p>Flip and add butter, garlic, sprigs of thyme, and any leftover sliced caps/stems. Let the butter melt,</p>
            <p>then butter baste the scallops to keep them moist and ensure they are cooking all the way through.</p></li>
        <li><p>Once they are golden brown on both sides, remove to a plate and sprinkle with salt and pepper.</p>
            <p>Optional: garnish with fresh thyme leaves.</p></li>
        
    </ol>
