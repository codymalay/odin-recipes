    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I was feeling adventurous when I tried this recipe! If you choose to make your own roux it can be very time</p>
    <p>consuming. Alternatively you can buy a premade roux at your local asian market. The benefit to making it on</p>
    <p>your own is that you can choose how dark you want your curry to be. I like mine dark, because it reminds me</p>
    <p>of some of the curries I tried when I traveled to Japan in high school. Either way, I'm sure you'll find this</p>
    <p>recipe to be delicious!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h4>Tofu Katsu</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 16 oz package firm tofu, drained and frozen (freezing is important to get a 'meat-like' texture on the tofu)</li>
        <li>1/4 c flour</li>
        <li>1/4 c egg substitute (we like aquafaba as a binding agent)</li>
        <li>1/2 c panko bread crumbs (MUST be panko. Italian bread crumbs won't give that iconic katsu texture)</li>
        <li>salt and pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Curry Roux</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tbsp plant-based butter</li>
        <li>4 tbsp flour</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tbsp curry powder</li>
        <li>1 tbsp garam masala</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp cayenne pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Japanese Curry</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb potatoes, peeled and cubed</li>
        <li>2 medium carrots, chopped (try to keep size consistent with the potatos)</li>
        <li>4 c veggie stock</li>
        <li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 small fuji apple, peeled, and roughly chopped</li>
        <li>1 tbsp soy sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 tbsp honey, or your preferred sweetener (skip if you want a less sweet curry, or if you have a particularly large apple)</li>
        <li>Option to add additional vegatables/mushrooms. A good hearty king oyster mushroom works well</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <p>Note: there are a lot of steps here. I recommend focusing on the roux first if making your own.</p>
    <p>Then, if you're a good multi-tasker, prep <str>everything</str> and while the curry is cooking,</p>
    <p>you can fry up your tofu. If that seems like too much to handle, make the tofu first. You can</p>
    <p>reheat in the microwave/oven once the curry is ready.</p>

    <h4>Making the Roux</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt the butter in a pot over medium-low heat, then whisk in the flour</li>
        <li>Stir continuously as the mixture begins to brown. This process should take roughly 10-12 mins. Be careful not to burn</li>
        <li>Once browned to your liking, add your spices and stir to combine. Remove from heat and refrigerate if not using immediately</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Making the Tofu Katsu</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Once tofu has thawed, squeeze gently between your hands to remove excess moisture</li>
        <li>Cut 'hamburger style' into 2 large slabs. Season both sides with salt and pepper</li>
        <li>Set up your dipping station with 3 bowls/plates, flour, egg substitute, and panko. Season the flour and panko as desired</li>
        <li>Dip the tofu first in flour, then egg substitute, then panko. Be sure to coat generously with panko</li>
        <li>Heat 1/2 inch neutral oil in a skillet over medium heat. You'll know it's hot when you drop a breadcrumb in the oil and it sizzles</li>
        <li>Place tofu in the hot oil and fry on both sides. When frying, <str>always</str> place the tofu away from your body to avoid splash back</li>
        <li>Tofu will be ready when it is golden brown on each side. Try to only flip once, and lower the heat if it's browning too quickly. Should only take a few mins each sides</li>
        <li>When done, place on a draining rack. Do not move directly to a plate unless ready to eat as panko will get soggy</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Making the Curry</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>If using mushrooms, saute in a dutch oven over medium heat then transfer to a plate</li>
        <li>Saute onions until carmelized</li>
        <li>Add carrots, potatoes, and mushrooms back to the onions and cook for another minutes or two</li>
        <li>Add veggie stock, bring to a boil then add a lid and reduce heat to let it simmer</li>
        <li>Check potatos with a chopstick/fork periodically. It's ready when the potatoes give no resistance</li>
        <li>When the curry cooks, puree the apple</li>
        <li>When potatoes are done, add soy sauce, apple, sweetener, and season to taste</li>
        <li>Stir the roux into the curry. If you have one, using a sieve helps evenly distribute</li>
        <li>Serve over rice with the tofu katsu and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Additional Notes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Sweetness is a hallmark of a good japanese curry! Not too sweet, but it deserves a seat at the table with the other flavors</li>
        <li>If making your own roux, feel free to increase the measurements and save some for later! It will save you time and a good homemmade roux is hard to beat!</li>
    </ul>
