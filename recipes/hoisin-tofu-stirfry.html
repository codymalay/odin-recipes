    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p class="desc">This sauce is a homemade recipe that  came to fruition after finding a recipe that I wanted to try, but I realized I didn't have the ingredients I needed for the sauce! So, I slapped together the substitutes I had in the fridge and viola, new recipe achieved! This is best served  over steamed rice, but I like using quinoa as well. Sweet, spicy and most importantly, tasty!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="desc">
        <li>1 block extra firm tofu, pressed</li>
        <li>1 red bell pepper, sliced into chunks</li>
        <li>1-2 shallots, sliced</li>
        <li>2-3 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 thumb ginger, minced</li>
        <li>3 tbsp hoisin</li>
        <li>2 tbsp soy sauce</li>
        <li>1-2 tbsp gochujang</li>
        <li>1 tbsp white wine vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tbsp mirin</li>
        <li>Red pepper flakes for desired spice level</li>
        <li>Green onions, chopped</li>
        <li>Option to add any other veggies you have on hand</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol class="desc">
        <li>Heat a nonstick skillet over medium heat and chop tofu into bite size pieces</li>
        <li>Add good amount of oil and fry tofu. You need enough oil for a shallow fry. If frying in batches, add oil between each batch. Place tofu on a wire rack when golden brown on all sides</li>
        <li>While tofu is cooking, mix sauce ingredientss until well blended - hoisin, soy sauce, gochujang, white wine vinegar, mirin, and red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>Once tofu is done, remove nonstick skillet and add wok to the burner over medium-high heat with a drizzle of oil</li>
        <li>Add peppers and shallots and cook 3-4 minutes, stirring often tto prevent burning</li>
        <li>Add ginger and garlic, stirring constantly for 30 seconds or until fragrant</li>
        <li>Add sauce and tofu to the pan. Toss to coat tofu and cook a few more minutes until sauce thickens</li>
        <li>Serve over rice, and garnish with green onions. I also like to layer a handful of spinach between the rice and tofu, and sprinkle  everything with sesame seeds</li>
    </ol>
